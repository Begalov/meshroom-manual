*You can drag and drop different OBJ and PLY files as layers.*

.. image:: 10000000000002800000016EE902B71EB0CF756B.jpg

*So in this case I have a layer for both the final mesh and the SFM points/cameras. Sometimes the mesh smoothing step can be a little too aggressive so I find it useful to compare between the original mesh and the smooth mesh. If the mesh looks broken, the PLY sfm data and the OBJ meshes are great for tracing through the pipeline.*


clean up / delete / smooth

The first thing you want to do is to rotate your model and align it with the coordinate system.

You can import the obj into
`Meshlab <http://www.meshlab.net/#download>`_
then go to
**Filters ``>`` Normals, Curvatures **
and
**Orientation ``>`` Transform: Rotate**
** **
and align it yourself from there.
** **

There might be some parts of the model or the scene you want to remove.

You can select â€¦.. then remove...

Smooth mesh

If you don't like the smoothing results from Meshroom, you can smooth the mesh yourself.

Meshroom2Blender Blender Plugin
-------------------------------

Blender importer for AliceVision Meshroom

datafiles: cameras, images, sparse pointcloud and obj's.

Basic implementation of Meshroom importer. If you have sophisticated node tree it will use only the first nodes from the file. Addon assumes you did compute each stages/nodes, and the output is same. Visit
`the Github project site <https://github.com/tibicen/meshroom2blender>`_
for details.

BlenderLandscape
----------------


Addon for Blender 2.79b. 3DSurvey Collection of tools to improve the work-flow of a 3D survey (terrestrial or UAV photogrammetry). Import multiple objs at once (with correct orientation), for instance a bunch of models made in Meshroom.

Instant Meshes
--------------

includes quick intro


why do we want to use it?
It is a really fast auto-retopology solution and helps you create more accurate meshes

Export model to Unity
---------------------

Start Unity, open your project and your asset folder.

Navigate in the file Explorer of your OS to the assets subfolder where you want to store your Photogrammetry object.


Copy the model.obj and texture.jpg (or other supported file types) from the Meshroom Export folder to the Unity assets subfolder.

Open Unity and wait for the auto-import to complete.


You might want to optimize your mesh
and texture for ingame use.

.. image:: 10000000000002DB000001F391C11C901F15F96E.jpg

Now you can add your model to the scene.


There is a little more to do to create a simple demo game, like adding a Mesh collider, optimize the texture,...

`Unity homepage <https://unity3d.com>`_
.


Here is a manual on how to optimize photogrammetry objects inside Unity:

Export to Maya (Plugin)
-----------------------

**MeshroomMaya**
(v0.4.2) is a Maya plugin that enables to model 3D objects from images.

`https://github.com/alicevision/MeshroomMaya <https://github.com/alicevision/MeshroomMaya>`_

This plugin is not available at the moment.

Use the Export to Maya node instead.



Alembic bridge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Export from Meshroom for Maya*

Use the Export to Maya node to export the Alembic ABC file

*Import in Nuke/Mari*

In menu "NukeMVG ``>`` Import Alembic" , .abc file can be loaded. The tool create the graph of camera projection. Result can be export to Mari via Nuke <-> Mari bridge.
