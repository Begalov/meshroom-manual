KeyframeSelection
=================

**Description** Note: This is an experimental node for keyframe
selection in a video, which removes too similar or too blurry images.
This node is not yet provided in the binaries as it introduces many
dependencies. So if you built it by yourself, you can test the
KeyframeSelection node. It is not yet fully integrated into Meshroom, so
you have to manually drag&drop the exported frames to launch the
reconstruction (instead of just adding a connection in the graph)
