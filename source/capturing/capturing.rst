Capturing
=========

If this is the first time you are using photogrammetry software, read the following chapter on how to take good photos for your project.

**Basics**
------

- Your scene/object should be well lit. 
- Avoid shadows, reflections, and transparent objects.
- Take the photos in diffuse or indirect lighting, such as on an overcast day (if outside) or using multiple light sources (if inside).
- DonÂ´t use the flash setting on the camera.
- Do not change the focal length/zoom while shooting. Use a fixed lens if possible.
- Try to take pictures from all angles.
- Avoid moving objects in the scene or background.
- If taking pictures using a rotating rig, make sure to use a plain color background with no distiguishable features.
- The object of interest should always fill most of the image.
- Take images with a side overlap of 60% minimum and frontal overlap of 80% minimum.
- For each shot, move to a new position (or rotate the object).
- Do not take multiple images from the same spot.
- You can photograph an area multiple times in different patterns for better coverage.
- Avoid shaky, blurry, or warped images.
- The more images you have, the better. You can always filter out repetitive or bad images to reduce processing time.
