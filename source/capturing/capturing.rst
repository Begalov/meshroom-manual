Capturing
=========

If this is the first time you are using photogrammetry software, read the following chapter on how to take good photos for your project.

Basics
------

- Your Scene/Object should be well lit. 
- Avoid shadows and reflections and transparent objects.
- Best shoot in indirect light such as in the daylight shadow of a building avoid plain and one-colored surfaces
- Don´t use a flash.
- Do not change the focal length while shooting or use a fixed lens.
- Make sure you can take pictures from all angles.
- Avoid moving objects in the scene or background!
- Rotate only objects with a plain background
- The Object of interest should always fill most of the image
- Take images with a side overlap of min. 60% and frontal overlap of 80%.
- For each shot, move to a new position (or rotate the object)
- Do not take multiple images from the same spot.
- You can photograph multiple times in different patterns to leave no blind spots
- avoid shaking
- The more images you have, the better. You can always decide not to use them…
