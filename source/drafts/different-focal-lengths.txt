Different focal length
======================

(For the FAQ)


Taking pictures with different focal lengths or lenses should be avoided.

Meshroom can handle different focal lengths or lenses, but you need to make sure that:
- the focal length is stored in the EXIF
- the lense serial number is stored in the EXIF when using differnt lenses on the same camera


When using multiple camera models, make sure the EXIF is complete, so Meshroom can distinct them.
