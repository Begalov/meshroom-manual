About Meshroom
==============

Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the `AliceVision <https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision>`_ framework. AliceVision is a Photogrammetric Computer Vision Framework which provides 3D Reconstruction and Camera Tracking algorithms. AliceVision aims to provide strong software basis with state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms that can be tested, analyzed and reused. The project is a result of collaboration between academia and industry to provide cutting-edge algorithms with the robustness and the quality required for production usage.

Project history
---------------

In 2010, the `IMAGINE <http://imagine.enpc.fr/>`_ research team (a joint research group between `Ecole des Ponts ParisTech <http://www.enpc.fr/en>`_ and `Centre Scientifique et Technique du Batiment <http://international.cstb.fr/>`_) and Mikros Image started a partnership around `Pierre Moulon’s thesis <http://www.theses.fr/2014PEST10337>`_, supervised by Renaud Marlet and Pascal Monasse on the academic side and Benoit Maujean on the industrial side. In 2013, they released an open source SfM pipeline, called openMVG (“Multiple View Geometry”), to provide the basis of a better solution for the creation of visual effects `matte-paintings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_painting>`_.

In 2009, the CMP research team from CTU started Michal Jancosek’s PhD thesis supervised by Tomas Pajdla. They released Windows binaries of their MVS pipeline, called CMPMVS, in 2012.

In 2009, INPT, INRIA and Duran Duboi started a French ANR project to create a model based Camera Tracking solution based on natural features and a new marker design called CCTag.

In 2015, Simula, INPT and Mikros Image joined their efforts in the EU project `POPART <http://www.alicevision.org/popart>`_ to create a Previz system. In 2017, CTU joined the team in the EU project
`LADIO <http://www.alicevision.org/ladio>`_ to create a central hub with structured access to all data generated on set.

Open Source
-----------

We build a fully integrated software for 3D reconstruction, photo modelling and camera tracking. We aim to provide a strong software basis with state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms that can be tested, analyzed and reused. Links between academia and industry is a requirement to provide cutting-edge algorithms with the robustness and the quality required all along the visual effects and shooting process.
This open approach enables both us and other users to achieve a high degree of integration and easy customization for any studio pipeline.

Beyond our project objectives, open source is a way of life. We love to exchange ideas, improve ourselves while making improvements for other people and discover new collaboration opportunities to expand everybody’s horizon.
