Import Images
=============

Drag and drop your images or your image folder into the **Images** pane on the left hand side.

You can preview the images in the **Image Viewer** pane. To display the image metadata click the (i) icon in the bottom right corner. For images with embedded GPS information an additional openstreetmap frame will be displayed.

.. note::

  If your images won't appear in the **Images** pane after you imported them, your camera was not recognized correctly.
  Make sure the EXIF data contains all relevant camera information.
  If the import still fails, your camera is not in the database or your image files are not valid.
