**Documentation**

Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the
`AliceVision <https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision>`_
framework.

AliceVision is a Photogrammetric Computer Vision Framework which provides 3D Reconstruction and Camera Tracking algorithms. AliceVision aims to provide strong software basis with state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms that can be tested, analyzed and reused. The project is a result of collaboration between academia and industry to provide cutting-edge algorithms with the robustness and the quality required for production usage.
