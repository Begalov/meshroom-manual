# How to contribute

- make yourself familiar with ReStructuredText and Sphinx
- do not make any changes to the general structure (yet)
- open an Issue for questions

# Common conventions

- write one sentence per line of your editor.
  This helps versioning the code and checking the differences.

- for sections here are the markers and the order of nesting

  ```rst

  First
  =====

  Second
  ~~~~~~

  Third
  +++++

  Fourth
  ------
