The Command-line interface (CLI)
================================

The CLI starting with the Meshroom GUI is in a read-only mode, so you can see every step of the processes in meshroom being executed. You can not enter any commands in this CLI.

You can monitor the CLI for errors.

Important: **Do not close the CLI window or Meshroom will close!**

Info: The message Failed to download scene at QUrl("") is just a warning from the UI library (Qt) when no file is loaded in the 3D viewer and nothing to worry about.
