Contributing
============

Alice Vision relies on a friendly and community-driven effort to create an open source photogrammetry solution.

The project strives to provide a
**pleasant**
environment for everybody and tries to be as
**non-hierarchical**
as possible. Every
**contributor**
is considered as a member of the team, regardless if they are a newcomer or a long time member. Nobody has
**special**
rights or prerogatives.
The contribution workflow relies on
`Github Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_
. We recommend to discuss new features before starting the development, to ensure that development is efficient for everybody and minimize the review burden.

In order to foster a friendly and cooperative atmosphere where technical collaboration can flourish, we expect all members of the community to be courteous, polite and respectful in their treatment of others helpful and constructive in suggestions and criticism stay on topic for the communication medium that is being used be tolerant of differences in opinion and mistakes that inevitably get made by everyone.
